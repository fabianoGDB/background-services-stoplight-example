Background Services Stoplight Example
This project demonstrates the implementation of background services in .NET using a semaphore-based approach to manage concurrency. It simulates real-world scenarios such as automatic settlements and bank slip (boleto) generation, ensuring controlled access to shared resources.

🚦 Overview
In applications where multiple background tasks operate concurrently, managing access to shared resources is crucial. This example utilizes SemaphoreSlim to limit the number of concurrent operations, preventing resource contention and ensuring thread safety.

SemaphoresBackgroundServiceManagement.cs: Manages semaphore logic to control concurrent access.

SettlementService.cs: Simulates automatic settlement processing.

BoletoService.cs: Simulates bank slip generation.

Program.cs: Configures and runs the hosted services.

Building the Project
Clone the repository:

bash
Copiar código
git clone https://github.com/fabianoGDB/background-services-stoplight-example.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copiar código
cd background-services-stoplight-example/BackgroundServices.Api
Build the project:

bash
Copiar código
dotnet build
Running the Application
bash
Copiar código
dotnet run
Upon execution, the application will start the background services, and you'll observe console outputs simulating the processing of settlements and bank slip generations.

🧪 Features
Semaphore-Based Concurrency Control: Ensures that only a specified number of background tasks run concurrently.

Simulated Financial Operations: Mimics real-world processes like settlements and boleto generation.

Console Logging: Provides real-time feedback on the operations being performed.
